For reading data, shutil library was used to get data in data_flow_from _directory form of tensorflow, 
later attempts used dataflow from dataframe which did the conversion directly.
Initial attempts were to create an image classifier using tensorflow and keras.
I went upto 6 layers while even after 50 epochs accuracy was just about 11%

So it was clear there had to be some sort of transfer learning to be done.
Thus the searxh for pretrained models begin.

Since it is my first time using pretrained models....it took me some time to figure out the way....keras documentation helped a lot 

Models I tried in order are
VGG16
Resnet50
Resnet101
InceptionV3
InceptionResNetV2
RenNet101V2
Xception
NASNetLarge
These too were found in the documentation guide.

There was some uncertainity of the inclusion of validation set in the model training. some allowed where as some gave error, this is something i am not clear about.

Resnet101V2 gave the best results!
